## About SimpleX Chat
[SimpleX Chat](https://simplex.chat/) is a secure messaging solution with a strong emphasis on user privacy. It's (naturally) end-to-end encrypted, doesn't require (or collect) *any* information about you in order to sign up, doesn't use any persistent user identifiers (not even a randomly-generated one), isn't associated with any cryptocurrency project, and is fully decentralized.

Incoming messages are routed through a pool of servers so that your conversations don't all follow the same path - and no server knows anything about conversations that aren't routed through it. Servers only hold your messages long enough to ensure they get to you, and those messages only exist in the encrypted database on your device once they've been delivered. SimpleX also makes it easy to back up that database and restore it on a new device so you don't lose any messages or contacts.

The app is also packed with other features like disappearing messages, encrypted file transfers, encrypted voice messages, encrypted audio and video calls, decentralized private groups, and a cool incognito mode which connects new conversations to a randomly-generated profile instead of your primary one. There's even a [CLI client](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/docs/CLI.md)!

## Servers
One of the really attractive aspects of SimpleX is its decentralized nature. You can easily host your own [simplexmq server](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq) for routing your messages, and I've done just that. In fact, I've deployed three of them. As one of my closest internet friends, you're welcome to use them as well. Just add these in the SimpleX app at **Settings > Network & servers > SMP servers > + Add server...**. You can enable the option to use them for new connections, and *disable* that option on the default server list if you'd like - or leave them enabled to maximize the decentralized aspect.
