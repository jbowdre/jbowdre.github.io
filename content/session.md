![:left](/logos/session.png)[Session](https://getsession.org/) is a private messaging app that protects your metadata, encrypts your communications, and makes sure your messaging activities leave no digital trail behind. It is decentralized, end-to-end encrypted, and fully anonymous. Unlike some alternatives, you don't need to provide/verify a phone number, email address, or any other personal information whatsoever in order to create a Session account.

While [Snikket](/xmpp/) is a great solution for private communications with people you already know, Session makes sense for private communications outside of your immediate circle.

###### All that is to say:
- If you'd like to message me on Session, simply scan this code in the [Session app](https://getsession.org/download):
