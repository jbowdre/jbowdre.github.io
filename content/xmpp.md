> XMPP is the [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol](https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/), a set of open technologies for instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data.

![:left](/logos/snikket.png)That means you can pick from many different clients and have a free choice of server operators to communicate with me. I've chosen to use [Snikket](https://snikket.org/) which makes it easy to self-host your own server for truly-decentralized, federated, end-to-end encrypted communications which doesn't rely on servers run by unknown parties. 

Unlike many other XMPP solutions, though, Snikket doesn't support open registrations; in order to use the Snikket client you'll need to either host your own Snikket server or find someone willing to invite you to create an account on theirs. Users of other XMPP clients and servers can still communicate with Snikket users though thanks to the magic of open standards and federation. 

###### All that is to say:
- If you're already using Snikket (or [another XMPP client](https://xmpp.org/software/clients/)), you can message me at `{{<cloakemail address="john@chat.vpota.to" protocol="xmpp">}}`
- If you're interested in hosting your own Snikket server in the cloud *for free*, check out [my post on doing just that](/snikket-private-xmpp-chat-on-oracle-cloud-free-tier/)
- I'm happy to send you an invite to create an account on my server; you'll just need to use one of my other contact options to let me know
